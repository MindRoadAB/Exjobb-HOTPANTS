BACH was created as a part of a master thesis conducted at Linköping University during the spring of 2023 by [Annie Wång](https://github.com/th3tard1sparadox) and [Victor Lells](https://github.com/vollells). It is a PSF-alignment and image subtraction tool based on [HOTPANTS](https://github.com/acbecker/hotpants).

***NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT***

# Installation

Install all dependencies and then clone the repo by running the following command:

    git clone git@github.com:MindRoadAB/Exjobb-HOTPANTS.git

You can then use the program. See how to use BACH further below.

## Dependencies

BACH depends on the following packages:
- [CCfits](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/)
- [C++ for OpenCL 2021](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/assets/CXX_for_OpenCL.html)

## Requirements

- CMake or Make depending on your OS
    - If you are using CMake, Visual Studio 17 2022 is also required
- C++20

# Usage

BACH will be compiled differently depending on what system you are on, follow the guide for your system below.

## Windows

We recommend that you use CMake if you run Windows. 

To compile BACH with CMake, make sure that `CMakeLists.txt` contain the correct paths to the libraries used. These can be found under `Include directories` and `Dependencies`.

When the paths are set correctly, open a terminal and navigate into the folder containing `CMakeLists.txt` and run the commands

    cmake -S . -B "build" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A "x64"
    cmake --build .\build\

The exe file can be found in the folder `build/Debug` named `BACH.exe`. Move this file to the folder containing all `.cl` files. This can be done using the following command if you are standing in the `BACH` folder.

    mv .\build\Debug\BACH.exe .

Then run the file:

    .\BACH.exe -t [template image filename] -s [science image filename]

## Linux

If you are running Linux, we recommend that you use Make. Navigate to the folder containing `Makefile` and run

    make

Then execute the file by running

    ./BACH -t [template image filename] -s [science image filename]

## Command line options

These are the available command line options. The values within the parenthesis are the default values.

### Required

    -t [template image filename] // needs to be a FITS image
    -s [science image filename]  // needs to be a FITS image

### Optional

    -o [output image filename] // will output a FITS image (diff.fits)
    -op [output path]          // (out/)
    -ip [input path]           // (res/)
    -v                         // turn on verbose mode
